# Universal web app server

NGINX Unit is a lightweight and versatile application runtime
that provides the essential components for your web application
as a single open-source server:
running application code
(including WebAssembly),
serving static assets,
handling TLS and request routing.

Unit was created by
[nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
team members from scratch
to be highly efficient
and fully configurable at runtime.
The latest version is 1.32.1,
released on Mar 26, 2024.
