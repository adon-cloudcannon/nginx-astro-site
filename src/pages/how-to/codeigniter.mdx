# CodeIgniter

To run apps built with the [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com) web framework using Unit:

1\. Install [Unit](../installation.md#installation-precomp-pkgs) with a PHP language module.

2\. Download CodeIgniter’s [core files](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) and [build](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) your application. Here, let’s use a [basic app template](https://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-73103.html), installing it at **/path/to/app/**.

3\. Run the following command so Unit can access :

<Code_Block language="bash" hints={[{ number: "1", display_text: "unit:unit", tooltip: "User and group that Unit's router runs as by default", nxt_type: "nxt_hint" }, { number: "2", display_text: "/path/to/app/", tooltip: "Path to the application files such as /data/www/app/; use a real path in your commands", nxt_type: "nxt_ph" }]}>{`   # chown -R NXT1 NXT2`}</Code_Block>

<Note type="note">
The **unit:unit** user-group pair is available only with [official packages](../installation.md#installation-precomp-pkgs), Docker [images](../installation.md#installation-docker), and some [third-party repos](../installation.md#installation-community-repos). Otherwise, account names may differ; run the **ps aux \| grep unitd** command to be sure.
</Note>

For further details, including permissions, see the [security checklist](security.md#security-apps).

4\. Next, [prepare](../configuration.md#configuration-php) the CodeIgniter configuration for Unit:

```json
   {
       "listeners": {
           "*:80": {
               "pass": "routes"
           }
       },

       "routes": [
           {
               "match": {
                   "uri": ":nxt_hint:`!/index.php <Denies access to index.php as a static file>`"
               },

               "action": {
                   ":nxt_hint:`share <Serves static files>`": ":nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`public$uri",
                   "fallback": {
                       ":nxt_hint:`pass <Serves any requests not served with the 'share' immediately above>`": "applications/codeigniter"
                   }
               }
           }
       ],

       "applications": {
           "codeigniter": {
               "type": "php",
               "root": ":nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`public/",
               "script": ":nxt_hint:`index.php <All requests are served by a single script>`"
           }
       }
   }
```

5\. Upload the updated configuration.  Assuming the JSON above was added to `config.json`:

```bash
   # curl -X PUT --data-binary @config.json --unix-socket \
          :nxt_ph:`/path/to/control.unit.sock <Path to Unit's control socket in your installation>` :nxt_hint:`http://localhost/config/ <Path to the config section in Unit's control API>`
```

#### NOTE

The [control socket](../controlapi.md#configuration-socket) path may vary; run **unitd -h** or see [Startup and Shutdown](source.md#source-startup) for details.

After a successful update, your app should be available on the listener’s IP address and port:
